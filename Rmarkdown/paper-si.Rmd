Figures S3--4 and S6--7 summarize the parameters of models fitted to observed and simulated data, respectively, including all of the spline coefficients (the weights applied to the basis functions). The statistic $\widehat{R}$ is a convergence metric; at convergence $\widehat{R}$ is equal to 1, and an $\widehat{R}$ less than 1.1 is usually taken to represent approximate convergence [@gelman_bayesian_2014]. Here, all $\widehat{R}$ values were less than 1.05. The effective sample size $N_{eff}$ measures the amount by which autocorrelation in the MCMC chains increases uncertainty in the parameter estimates. That is, $N_{eff}$ has the same estimation power as the $N$ autocorrelated samples. An effective sample size greater than 100 per chain is considered adequate. Here, effective sample sizes for all parameters exceeded this threshold.
